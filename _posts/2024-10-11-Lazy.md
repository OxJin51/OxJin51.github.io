- 开头：描述一个场景（与话题有关/贴近现实）**讽刺的现象**

- 论证：取决于怎么使用

If it were the true ***culprit***,how do others leverage the same tools to master new skills or build startups from scratch?Clearly,technology doesn't shape our actions but broaden our options. A tool is only as effectives as the one wielding it,yet we blame the paintbrush for an unfinished masterpieces--how absurd!!

Now, will you still point the finger at technology for your lethargy?Use it innovate or waste time--it's entirely up to you. Before blaming your phone , remember, it's not the one watching all those Chiikawa videos -- you are/ the choice between innovation and indulgence is ours to make.
